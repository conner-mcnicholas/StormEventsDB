-----------------------------------INITIAL FILES PIPELINE TEST-------------------------------------------

  RUNNING ADF INITIAL PIPELINE
    PULLS ALL CSVGZ FILES FROM SOURCE TO DATA LAKE "allfiles" CONTAINER:
      -- SET FILES_ROWCOUNT -> FOR EACH BLOB IN "allfiles", UNZIP DOWNLOADED DATA STREAM AND COUNT # ROWS, SUMMING GRAND TOTAL

    LOADS DATA FROM "allfiles" TO TABLES IN MYSQL:
      -- SET TABLES_ROWCOUNT -> select count(*) from {table};-- (all rows in the table after initial load)

  VERIFY FILES_ROWCOUNT == TABLES_ROWCOUNT 

-----------------------------------MONTHLY UPDATE FILE PIPELINE TEST-------------------------------------------

  IN BLOB CONTAINER
  -- RENAME 2022 FILE IN ARCHIVE CONTAINER TO SHOW MODIFIED DATE OF LAST MONTH 20220516

  IN UPDATE SCRIPT, (PRIOR TO RUNNING UPDATE LOGIC)

  -- SET RowsPreDelete -> SELECT count(*) FROM test_{table};-- (all rows in table before deletion)
  -- DELETE from TEST_{table} where BEGIN_YEARMONTH = '202203';

  RUNNING ADF UPDATE PIPELINE WILL IDENTIFY NEWER SOURCE FILE AVAILABLE THAN THE FILE WE RENAMED 20220616, APPENDS ALL 202203 ROWS

  IN CLEANUP SCRIPT, (AT VERY END, BUT ORDER DOESNT MATTER)

  -- Set RowsPostUpdate -> select count(*) from test_{table};-- (all rows in this table after update)

  VERIFY vPreDelete.RowsPostUpdate == RowsPreDelete


-----------------------------------YEARLY NEW FILE PIPELINE TEST------------------------------------------------

  IN BLOB CONTAINER
  -- DELETE 2022 FILE IN ARCHIVE CONTAINER

  IN NEW SCRIPT, (PRIOR TO RUNNING NEW FILE LOGIC)

  -- SET RowsPreDelete -> SELECT count(*) FROM test_{table};-- (all rows in table before deletion)
  -- DELETE from TEST_{table} where SUBSTR(YEARMONTH,1,5) = 2022

  RUNNING ADF NEW PIPELINE WILL IDENTIFY NEW SOURCE FILE AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT YEAR, APPENDS ALL 2022 ROWS

  IN CLEANUP SCRIPT, (AT VERY END, BUT ORDER DOESNT MATTER)

-- Set RowsPostInsert -> select count(*) from test_{table};-- (all rows in this table after all file rows inserted)

VERIFY RowsPostInsert == RowsPreDelete
